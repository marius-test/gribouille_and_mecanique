# gribouille_and_mecanique

An original 2D pixel art RPG developed in **Godot Engine 4**.

This game tells a retro-style story inspired by my two cats: Gribouille (the black cat) and Mecanique (the grey cat).

The game is coded by me, with all art assets created by Mélanie S. (my partner).

This is an early-stage prototype with the goal of evolving into a fully original game.
